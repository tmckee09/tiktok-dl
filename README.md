__TikTok Downloader__

Welcome to the TikTok Downloader project. Whether you're a seasoned dev or just here to vibe code on weekends - you're in the right place. 
Here's how to get started:

__ðŸ”’ Permissions & Rules__
- Repo is under the MIT License (See GitHub -> Repository -> MIT License)
- Only approved collaborators can push directly to main
- Keep .env keys private â€” donâ€™t commit them!
- (.env files store environment variables - usually API Keys, tokens, or config values your app needs to work, but that shouldnâ€™t be exposed publicly)

__ðŸš« Never Do This:__

"const apiKey = "my-secret-api-key";"

If you push API Keys to GitHub:

- They're visible to the public if the repo is public
- Bots can steal and misuse them

  __Step 1: Download Git and Node.js__
  
__-- Open Terminal and Copy__

winget install --id Git.Git -e

__--Paste in Terminal -> Type 'Y' to Confirm__

__--Then Copy:__ 

winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e

__-- Paste in Terminal -> Confirm on prompt__

__After this, you're ready to clone the repository to your machine to edit it. Copy and paste this in terminal:__

git clone https://github.com/tmckee09/tiktok-dl.git

cd tiktok-dl

npm install

npm run dev

__(After, it should say 'Starting' and then you can go to "http://localhost:3000" in your browser to view what changes you are making to the code in real-time before we push it to Vercel to be shown publicly. Vercel is the host - PM on Discord for access)__

__// if you get a lucide-react error when running the website locally, just copy/paste this in terminal__ 

npm install lucide-react

npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

__//any other error Copy/Paste it into ChatGPT and it will tell you how to resolve it__

- __Need to add breadth to the page now__

  ~~- An area to Paste a TikTok link~~ - expand on this
  - Extend the black top portion to the bottom of the page, then white on the bottom for separation of the top half where the downloader is and the bottom half where the information and how it works goes
  - Black Colors // TikTok themed as much as possible
  - Modern/Sleek design
  - SEO wording within the pages to attract lurking Google searchers
  - Pages, Pages, Pages - as many relatable pages about downloading TikTok videos, etc as we can create to drive the search optimization
 
  __Apps to Access__
 - Github Repository (Need to be added as contributor to see this)
 - Vercel (Website Hosting - Push final code to this FROM GitHub - when you 'commit' on the project it will automatically upload this to the Live site.)
 - Node.js
 - Discord
 - ChatGPT Plus
 - VisualCode for better interface while editing locally
